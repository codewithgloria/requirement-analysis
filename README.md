# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
- This repository explores the process of requirement analysis in software development.
- Requirement analysis is the critical first step in the software development life cycle (SDLC), focused on understanding what the software should do and the constraints it must operate within.
- It involves identifying, documenting, and analyzing user and business needs to ensure the final product meets expectations and avoids costly mistakes later in the project.
